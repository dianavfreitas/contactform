            <h2> Meet Biscuit</h2>
            <p>Biscuit, a mutt, was rescued in poor health, struggling to survive. Thanks to generous donations, our team at Pawsitive Rescued, provided the medical care and rehabilitation she needed. Her transformation caught the eye of a local family at an adoption event, and it was love at first sight. Now, Bella enjoys sunny days and happy walks at the park with her new family. Her story showcases the powerful impact of every donation, helping us give dogs like Biscuit a second chance at a happy life.
